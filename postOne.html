            <h3><u>Regression Analysis</u></h3> <br>
                          The main output of the regression analysis is to identify the indicator 
                          which has the best relationship with a user-defined relative asset pair.
                        </p>

                        <br>

                        <p>After the user uploads the files, the system will cycle through multiple transformations and 
                        combinations of the assets and indicators, which is detailed in the tables below:</p>

                        <table  border="1" style="text-align:center">
                            <tr>

                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                              <td>Rolling Return Period</td>

                        </table>
                        
                        <br>

                        <table border="1">
                            <tr>
                              <th colspan="2">Indicator Transformations</th>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                              <td>Statistical Transformations</td>
                              <td>Untransformed, Log, Inverse, Z-Score, Difference, 2nd Order Derivative</td>

                        </table>
                        <br> 

                          <p>After the statistical transformations are completed for each indicator,
                           a stationarity check is conducted using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test. 
                          If a transformation is found to be non-stationary, it will be dropped from the analysis. </p>


                          <p>The regression is then run on the above variables with different analysis parameters, namely:</p>

                          <table border="1">

                            <tr>

                              <th>Parameters</th>
                              <th>Explanation</th>
                            </tr>

                            <tr>
                              <td>Time Lag</td>
                              <td>Measured in weeks: 0, 4, 8, 12,24 <br> -4, -8, -12, -24</td>
                              <td>Negative time lags refer t oassets being the leading variable and 
                              indicators being the lagging variable, while positive time lags reer to the opposite</td>
                            </tr>

                            <tr>
                              <td>Time Period</td>
                              <td>Measured in Years: 2, 5, 10, Maximum</td>
                              <td>-Maximum period: refers to full non-NA history for the particular relative asset 
                              or indicator pair of interest <br><br>
                              - if assets have histories shorter than required, they would be excluded from the analysis combinations
                              Eg: if Asset A has 7 years worth of history, it would be analysed for periods of 2, 5 and maximum period -
                              where maximum would be 7 years in this case</td>
                            </tr>
                          </table>

                          <br>
                          <p>The metric used in evaluating the fit of the regression line is Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The calculation
                          formula used is : 
                          <img src="images/post1/RMSE.png">
                          where Å· is the predicted value and y is the actual value of the dependent variable, which is the returns of the 
                          relative asset pair in this case. The rationale for using this metric is that it shows the absolute fit of the
                          regression line to the variables, and also shows how accurately the regression line predicts the returns of 
                          the relative asset. This would allow us to understand how significant this relationship can be 
                          while expanding changes in the relative asset returns in the future.

                          <br>
                          <h3><u>Cluster Analysis</u></h3>
                          <img src="image/post1/asset_cluster_workflow.png">
                          <img src="image/post1/cluster.png">
                          <br>
                          <p>
                          For the clustering metric, we used a Path Similarity Analysis (PSA) metric, Hausdorff distance. It is the 
                          distance between A and B with the smallest positive number r, such that every point of A is within distance r 
                          of some point of B, and every point of B is within distance r of some point of A. In other words, it is the 
                          greatest of all the distances from a point in one set to the closest point in the other set. 
                          </p>
                          <br>
                          <p>
                          For the clustering method, we used Hierarchical clustering. Hieracrchial clustering starts with all the data  
                          points assigned to a cluster of their own. The two nearest clusters are then merged into the same cluster. In the end, 
                          this algorithm terminates when there is only a single cluster let.
                          </p>

                          <p>In the application, users are able to select the specific rolling window to apply the clustering 
                          algorithm on. Upon selecting the rolling window, a dendrogram will be created to show the hierarchical 
                          clustering of the data. Based on the dendrogram, users are able to view the clusters at different distances.
                           A drop down list of distances will be created for users to select where they would like to cut the dendrogram at, 
                           obtaining the number of clusters at the respective selected distance. 

                          Upon selecting the distance level to cluster the data at, a new dendrogram will be displayed to show the distance
                           at which the user selected to cluster the data at. The lines of the assets are then coloured based on the clusters
                            that they belong to. The respective clusters will be returned in a tabular format, showing which assets belong 
                            to which cluster. On top of that, an asset network node graph will be displayed based on the clustering. 
                            The assets are coloured (same colours as the dendrogram) according to their clusters. The network asset graph 
                            shows the distance among the assets, allowing users to better visualise the relationship among the assets and 
                            at the same time, view which clusters they belong to. For now, a threshold of 0.15 is being set to avoid an 
                            overcrowded network asset graph. 

                          With the above information, users are able to choose what assets they would like to place in the same portfolio
                           based on how different they are by viewing which clusters they are in and how much they differ from the clusters
                            or other assets (based on the distance) to derive a diversified portfolio.
                          </p>
